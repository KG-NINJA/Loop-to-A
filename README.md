# OpenAI to Z: **Humanity Score** — a parallel metric for meaning, openness, and collaboration

> This document does **not** dispute the official results.
> It proposes an **additional** lens that surfaces values current leaderboards don’t fully capture: narrative clarity, archaeological grounding, openness, interpretability, and community spark.
> Evidence comes only from public artifacts (write-ups, demos, code, discussions) and my own observation notes. No private information is used. Names are omitted by design.

## Why another metric now?

Across the challenge, many participants noticed a mismatch between the **staged narrative layer** and the **scored technical layer**:

* A lively, sometimes theatrical **narrative track** (characters, staged conversations, meta-story) encouraged exploration and wonder.
* Final judging, however, concentrated on a **technical-strength track** (compute, completeness, scalability, reproducibility).
* Because open discussion yielded little scoring benefit—and risked idea leakage—many teams stayed silent until the end. “Stealth then submit” became rational.
* Result: the stage felt warm, but the scoreboard rewarded cold efficiency. The **two tracks diverged**.

The *Humanity Score* is offered to **bridge** that divergence without attacking anyone’s work.

## Humanity Score v1.0 (five axes, 0–20 each; total 100)

A rubric applied only to public evidence. It’s a **working standard**, not a verdict.

### 1) Narrative & Emotional Coherence (0–20)

* Clarity of motivation; precise metaphors; comfort with uncertainty (not only confident claims).
* Signs of **human authorship** in voice and structure—insight beyond templated prose.
* The story helps non-specialists understand *why* the discovery matters.

### 2) Archaeological Grounding (0–20)

* Connection to terrain, hydrology, and prior scholarship; plausible paths from data to human past.
* Discussion of historical implications, not just model performance.
* Engagement with **falsifiability** (alternative explanations, limits).

### 3) Openness & Reproducibility (0–20)

* Concrete “how-to”: data sources, preprocessing, model knobs, thresholds.
* Shareable artifacts (CSV/GeoJSON, notebooks, pipelines, demos).
* Even a **small** reproducible slice counts; not everyone has large compute.

### 4) Interpretability & Error Handling (0–20)

* Why a detection is convincing; what usually breaks; which false positives to expect.
* Transparent limits and next steps.
* Willingness to say “we don’t know (yet).”

### 5) Community Spark (0–20)

* Invitations to specialists and citizen scientists; pointers for replication or review.
* Venues for Q\&A, follow-ups, or field validation; evidence of **continued observation**.
* The project **lowers the barrier** for others to join, critique, and extend.

**Scoring policy.**

* Use only public materials.
* Publish **positive** attributions; keep any unresolved concerns anonymized.
* Treat every judgment as **provisional** and update with new evidence.

## The “two-track gap”: narrative theater vs. technical strength

Let’s name the tension—so we can fix it:

* **Narrative theater** (the performance track) invited curiosity, myth, and big questions. It drew people in—but did not noticeably change final scores.
* **Technical strength** (the scoreboard track) rewarded compute, scalability, and tidy packaging. It quietly encouraged silence, late reveals, and resource advantages.

**Costs of the gap**

* Fewer open debates; weaker bridges to archaeologists; less warmth in the commons.
* Impressive demos that sometimes under-explain their historical meaning.
* Amateurs and low-compute teams struggle to register their unique value: *insight*.

**Remedy**

* Keep the technical metric—**and add** the Humanity Score.
* Celebrate entries that help the field move together: interpretable, falsifiable, open, and communal—*without* penalizing rigorous engineering.

## How this complements official judging

Think in two dimensions: **Technical Strength** × **Humanity Score**.

* **Top-right** (high × high): exemplary science **and** public value.
* **Top-left** (high tech, lower humanity): strong engines; needs better stories/links to the past.
* **Bottom-right** (high humanity, lower tech): promising insight; needs maturing pipelines.
* **Bottom-left**: early sketches; keep exploring.

The aim is **movement to the top-right**, not shaming. Different teams can help each other climb.

## Publication plan (non-adversarial)

1. **Part I (this document):** define the rubric and its rationale.
2. **Part II:** announce *positive-only* alternative awards (anonymous where neutrality helps), each with a 100–150-word commendation and links to reproducible artifacts.
3. **Part III:** iterate the rubric with community feedback; log changes as a living standard.

All observations remain **hypotheses** until independently replicated.

---

## Method & safeguards

* **Evidence sources:** public write-ups, demos, code, and public discussions.
* **No naming for critique.** Proper names appear only in *praise*; any sensitive interpretation is anonymized.
* **Separation of concerns:** narrative/“theater” observations live in appendices; they never drive a score by themselves.
* **Versioning:** every change to the rubric or awards will be tracked and justified.

## FAQ (brief)

**Isn’t this just another leaderboard?**
No. It’s a **supplementary lens** that spotlights values underweighted by compute-heavy scoring.

**Why reward “story”?**
Because archaeology is about people. Here, “story” means *clear reasoning, contextual meaning, and honest limits*—not spectacle.

**Can low-compute projects score well?**
Yes. The rubric explicitly values interpretability, openness, and collaborative design—areas where small teams can excel.

---

## Invitation

If this resonates, help test the rubric. Suggest criteria, point to public artifacts worth learning from, or propose a small **replication slice** others can run. The fastest way to heal the two-track gap is to **measure what we claim to value**—and then reward it in public.
